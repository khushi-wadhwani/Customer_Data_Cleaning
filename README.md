Overview
The dataset originates from https://github.com/Pyluxi/aviation3, where the number of features has been intentionally reduced to streamline information. It encompasses comprehensive customer data along with aggregated activity records spanning two years, up to 2014. Key attributes encompassed in the dataset include the inaugural flight date, membership tier, geographical location, flight frequency, revenue generated within the previous year window, and subsequent year window.

This dataset presents an opportune platform for refining proficiency in data exploration, cleansing methodologies, and employing clustering techniques for customer RFM analysis.
